# churn-detection
A churn detection machine learning project is a project that aims to predict which customers are likely to leave a company or stop using its services. This is a common use case in many domains, such as telecom, banking, e-commerce, etc. Churn prediction can help businesses retain their customers and improve their revenue and customer satisfaction.

A typical churn detection machine learning project involves the following steps:

** 1.Exploratory Data Analysis:** This is the process of exploring and visualizing the data to understand its characteristics, distribution, patterns, and relationships. It can also help identify missing values, outliers, anomalies, and imbalanced classes in the data.  
** 2.Data Preprocessing:** This is the process of transforming and cleaning the data to make it suitable for machine learning models. It can involve encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, scaling numerical variables, balancing classes, and creating new features.  
** 3.Model Creation and Evaluation:** This is the process of selecting, training, and testing different machine learning models on the data. It can involve choosing appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC curve, etc., to measure the performance of the models. It can also involve tuning the hyperparameters of the models to optimize their results.  
** 4.Improving the Model:** This is the process of applying various techniques to enhance the performance and robustness of the model. It can involve feature selection or extraction, ensemble methods, cross-validation, regularization, etc.  

Some examples of machine learning models that can be used for churn prediction are logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), neural network, etc. In this repo I illustrate the SVC and compare it with logistic regression.
